Hi!

Yes, the backup is just a simple zip file.
You can edit it if you want, and the app will try to load it anyway, but be careful because it may become unusable.
If it does, you'll need to delete all the data (you can then load the original backup).

For more information, and to know how it is created/loaded, you can just check the source code:
